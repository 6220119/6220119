Hi 👋, I'm Ralph – a software engineer, specialized on frontend web development, working [**@grab**](https://github.com/grab) to support driver acquisition operations across Southeast Asia. I love learning new stuffs that make the www better, faster, and more accessible. 

These days, I work mostly with [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript), [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react), [GraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) and other frontend ecosystem libraries.

I value diversity, transparency, embrace failures and believe in growth mindset.

Places I have been to: 🇻🇳, 🇸🇬, 🇲🇾(Langkawi, Kuala Lumpur), 🇮🇳(Chennai), 🇮🇩(Jakarta), 🇺🇸(Calabasas)
